Replaces the word "Abortion" with the word "Infanticide" on all your websites.

If you're mad about this add-on, then don't use it.  Or start using it, and realize the way some pro-lifers see the world.  Around 15% of unborn children never get to see their parents because their parents murder them!

Some phrases won't really make sense. That is a cost to using this add-on.
E.g. Celeb got an abortion -> Celeb got an infanticide.
